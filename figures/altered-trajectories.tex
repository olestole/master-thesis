    \caption[Results from experiment 6: Altered trajectories]{Previously unseen trajectories being rendered by defining a new camera path for the trained NeRF. Image 1 illustrates a trajectory deviating across a traffic light zone, while image 2 shows a trajectory veering into the opposing lane. Image 3, derived from dataset 3, portrays a trajectory directed towards a road sign, and Image 4, derived from dataset 1, presents a trajectory swerving over the curb.}
