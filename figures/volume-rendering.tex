    \caption{The four basic steps of volume rendering \cite{wiki:Volume_ray_casting}. 1) A ray is cast from the image plane into the volume. 2) Points in the volume are sampled. 3) The points are shaded based on their $RGB\alpha$-value and the illumination-value gradients in relationship with the local light source. 4) The final pixel color is composited along the ray.}
