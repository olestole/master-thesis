\chapter*{Abstract}

In this study, we explored the potential of using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) for novel view synthesis. Our findings show that different NeRF methods perform differently on various scene types in terms of reconstruction quality and computational efficiency. We also found that increasing the number of input images can improve the performance of NeRF methods, but this comes at the cost of longer processing times. Overall, our findings support that NeRFs are effective for novel view synthesis.
