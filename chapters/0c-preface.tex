\chapter*{Preface}

This masters thesis concludes my five years at the Master’s degree programme in Computer Science at NTNU. The thesis explores the application of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) on data captured from vehicles. The opportunity to work in the dynamic field of NeRF has been particularly interesting, given the constant influx of new research.

I would like to thank my team of supervisors, Frank Lindseth and Gabriel Kiss. The experiments conducted would not have been made possible without your guidance, data capture endeavour and provisioning of computational resources.

Furthermore, I would like to express my gratitude to friends and family for their support and encouragement, with a special thanks extended to Camilla Dybdal. 

Lastly, I would like to thank NTNU and the city of Trondheim for five incredible years which I will never forget.
