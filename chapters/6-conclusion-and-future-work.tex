\chapter{Conclusion \& Future Work}

\section{Conclusion}
Conclude the thesis. Could create a holistic research goal that I could use to wrap up the thesis, or I could conclude what has been done, what worked and what should be looked into.



















\section{Future Work}
This section provides ideas related to NeRFs, synthetic data capture, and the extension to real-life data capture that were not covered in this report, but would be interesting to explore in future work.

\subsection{Improve pipeline for real-data capture}
Better estimate the rotation matrix from the collected data

\subsection{Large scale NeRF}
\begin{comment}
- Create a pipeline that enables the use of COLMAP for each segment in a more streamlined way. A succesful implementation should have significant implications on the quality of the resulting render.
- Mask transient objects using segmentation models
- Inverse distance weighing
- Visibility prediction
- Change backbone model to a model like F2 which have a different space warping algorithm, and should enable better results than using Nerfacto as the backbone model.
